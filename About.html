<p>Mitch Norris is an Australian who has lived and shot photos all around the world. Infact, he has taken photos on every continent except Antartica. 
<br>
He currently presides in Munich, Germany with his wife.</p>
<p>He draws inspiration from the ever change urban and natural landscape.<br>His style is a blend of by documentary, street, travel, portraiture and landscape photography, without specialising in any area in particular.<br>He captures moments which condure up feelings of beauty, despair, awe, sadness, love, anger, elation and much more in those that view his work.</p>
<p>Almost all of his photos are taken on 35mm film and analog cameras, ranging from the<br>Leica M6, Olympus 35DC, Nikon F501, Olympus 35RC, Olympus XA and many more.<br>But his current go to cameras are his two Olympus Mju-ii, his Minolta CLE and his Olympus OM2n.</p>
